Move away, nothing to watch, it's just another useless repository. Totally nothing to watch, believe me.                                                                                                                                                                                                            ...are you sure no one is listening? Ok, then what I was talking about? Oh, I yes, it's super secret and totaly useful repository with a lot of good stuff and etc. Wait a minute I think, someone is reading it?! Hey, you! Get out of here?! I've already told you there nothing to look for. Security! Please, help this person to find a way out....
                                                                                                                                                                                                            ...ok, looks like we can continue. So what I was walking about back then? Ah, yes, super secret and totaly useful repository. Hope no one who should not is listening/reading this, since it's super secret. Ok let's start... wait a minute, something wrong. My documents doesn't have report from Garry. Mike, please, ask Peter whether he checked Garry's report and then... Hey, you! I've already told you that you're not supposed to be here. Leave, now! Damn it!
